00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Deploy oracles in just a few clicks.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
First, you gather the data source and feed it to the indexer.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
And then from the indexer, you feed it to the relayer.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
That way, you can set up your own Oracle.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Run calculations directly on chain, like moving averages,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
multi-asset indexes, or risk metrics.

00:29.000 --> 00:58.000
So, unlock the true power of data with chain site.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
